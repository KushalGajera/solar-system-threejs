# 🌌 Solar System 3D Simulation – Frontend Assignment

This is an interactive 3D simulation of the solar system built using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/). It demonstrates the use of 3D rendering, object animation, UI interaction, and user controls — all implemented in JavaScript without CSS animations.
